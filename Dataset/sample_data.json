So my oldest got it and since he’s already had Covid with all of us, we all have immunity so no side affects for him. The rest of us didn’t even consider the vax.

Currently there are 3 vaccines that are using multi-dose vials with mercury in them, all available for infants at 6 months old. ->Afluria Quadrivalent (Seqirus) ->Fluzone Quadrivalent (Sanofi Pasteur) ->Flucelvax Quadrivalen (Seqirus) So knowing the multi-dose has mercury, we can just ask for the single dose vial right? If you scroll down to the footnote abbreviations, this is what you find: †† Fluzone Quadrivalent is approved for children aged 6 through 35 months at either 0.25 mL or 0.5 mL per dose; however, 0.25-mL prefilled syringes are no longer available. If a prefilled syringe of Fluzone Quadrivalent is used for a child in this age group, the dose volume will be 0.5 mL per dose. § The approved dose volume for Afluria Quadrivalent is 0.25 mL for children aged 6 through 35 months and 0.5 mL for persons aged ≥3 years. However, 0.25-mL prefilled syringes are no longer available. For children aged 6 through 35 months, a 0.25-mL dose must be obtained from a multidose vial. So they have to use the vials with mercury in them on 6 month old infants? Why are they no longer available? Do doctors have multiple brands of vaccine at their practice? or are they buying just one in bulk? If anyone can find me data on which vaccine brands are the most widely used and which are from multi-dose vials, Id greatly appreciate it. Most of the time when I bring up mercury still being in multi dose vaccines, the pro-vaxx complicity theorists always say only a few get multi dose vials, theyre rarely given anymore, especially not to babies, but they have 0 data to back it up. If any infant or pregnant mother is getting multi-dose mercury filled vaccines, thats unacceptable and should be criminal. Any thimerosal at any amount is unacceptable and shouldnt be in there in the first place either, but we should all know that by now.",

        "text": "@andylumm Dr. Aseem Malhotra tells Joe Rogan that a reanalysis of Pfizer and Modernas original clinical trial data shows that their COVID mRNA vaccines *INCREASE* your risks of serious adverse events, hospitalization, and death: In my whole career, looking at all of the drugs and knowing about many different prescribed medications, Ive never seen something that when you look at the data has such poor effectiveness and unprecedented harms. In the summer of last year, in the journal Vaccine, the highest-impact medical journal for vaccines, they published a reanalysis of Pfizer and Modernas original double-blinded randomized controlled trial. This is the highest quality of scientific evidence. Joseph Fraiman is an ER doctor and clinical data scientist from Louisiana. Associate editor of the BMJ, Dr. Peter Doshi. Dr. Robert Kaplan from Stanford. Some real eminence of integrity published this reanalysis, and what they found was this. In the trials that led to the approval of regulators worldwide, you were more likely to suffer a severe adverse event from taking the vaccine, hospitalization, disability, or life-changing event than you were to be hospitalized with COVID. This mRNA vaccine should likely have never been approved for a single human in the first place, and that rate of serious adverse events is at least 1 in 800... 1 in 800 is a very, very high figure. Weve pulled other vaccines for much less. The 1976 Swine Flu vaccine was pulled because it was found to cause a debilitating neurological condition called Guillan-Barre syndrome in about 1 in 100,000 people. The Rotavirus vaccine was suspended in 1999 because it was found to cause a form of bowel obstruction in kids in 1 of 10,000. This is at least 1 in 800. Its a no-brainer. So the question is, why have we not paused it? Study:",

They also say that these vaccines protect against 90% of HPV induced cancer BUT (quote)To date, protection against infections with the targeted HPV types has been found to last for at least 10 years with Gardasil (18), up to 11 years with Cervarix (17), and at least 6 years with Gardasil 9 (19)., which means that people can STILL GET INFECTED AND STILL GET CANCER when the vaccine LOSES EFFICACY.",
